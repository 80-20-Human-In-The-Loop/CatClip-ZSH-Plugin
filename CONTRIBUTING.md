# Contributing to Catclip

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Catclip! We follow the **80-20 Human-in-the-Loop** philosophy: 80% automation, 20% human wisdom, 100% workflow optimization.

## üê± Our Philosophy

When contributing to Catclip, please keep these principles in mind:

1. **Workflow Enhancement**: Features should help users work more efficiently with file content
2. **Human Control**: Users should understand and control what's being copied and when
3. **Transparency**: Code should be readable and well-documented with clear examples
4. **Privacy First**: Never collect or transmit user data without explicit consent
5. **Educational Value**: Help users understand their clipboard usage patterns

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

- Check existing issues first
- Provide clear reproduction steps
- Include your Zsh version, OS, and clipboard utility (xclip/xsel/wl-copy)
- Describe expected vs actual behavior
- Include relevant error messages

### Suggesting Features

Features that align with our philosophy:
- ‚úÖ Help users understand their file copying patterns
- ‚úÖ Provide actionable workflow insights
- ‚úÖ Respect user privacy and data

3. Make your changes following our code style
4. Test thoroughly (see testing section)
5. Update documentation if needed
6. Commit with clear messages: `git commit -m 'Add feature: description'`
7. Push to your fork: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
8. Open a Pull Request with detailed description

### Code Style

- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Comment complex logic with clear explanations
- Follow existing zsh scripting patterns
- Keep functions focused and small
- Add inline documentation for learning
- Use consistent error handling and messaging
- Include usage examples for new features

### Testing

Before submitting, test your changes with:

#### Basic Functionality
```bash
# Test basic operations
catclip README.md
catclipl LICENSE
catclips CONTRIBUTING.md
catclipn README.md 1 10
pwdclip
lsclip
clipshow
```

#### Edge Cases
```bash
# Test edge cases
catclip nonexistent.txt        # Should handle errors gracefully
catclip *.nonexistent          # Test glob expansion failures
catclipn README.md 50 25       # Test invalid line ranges
catclip /dev/null              # Test empty files
```

#### Multiple Environments
- Test with fresh installation
- Test with existing data files
- Test with different clipboard utilities (xclip, xsel, wl-copy)
- Test with and without Oh My Zsh
- Verify backward compatibility

#### Performance Testing
```bash
# Test with large files (if implementing file size features)
catclip --insights            # Test analytics generation
catclip --stats              # Test performance metrics
```

## üìö Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Catclip-ZSH-Plugin.git
cd Catclip-ZSH-Plugin

# Create a test installation
./install.sh local

# For Oh My Zsh users, create a development symlink
ln -sf $(pwd)/catclip.plugin.zsh ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/catclip-dev/catclip.plugin.zsh

# Add catclip-dev to your plugins for testing
# Edit ~/.zshrc: plugins=(... catclip-dev)

# Reload shell to test changes
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Make changes** to `catclip.plugin.zsh`
2. **Reload shell**: `source ~/.zshrc` 
3. **Test functionality** with various commands
4. **Check analytics** with `catclip --insights`
5. **Verify no regressions** with existing features
