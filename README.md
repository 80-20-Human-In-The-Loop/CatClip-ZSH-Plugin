Catclip makes working with file contents effortless by providing intelligent clipboard utilities that learn from your usage patterns. Copy files, directories, and code snippets with simple commands while gaining insights into your workflow.

## What Catclip Does

Catclip helps you work smarter with file contents by providing:
- **Smart file copying**: `catclip file.txt` copies content directly to clipboard
- **Line-specific copying**: `catclipn file.py 10 20` copies specific line ranges
- **Multi-file support**: `catclip *.js` copies multiple files with separators
- **Directory utilities**: `pwdclip`, `lsclip` for path and listing operations
- **Workflow insights**: Learn about your clipboard usage patterns

## üî• The Core Workflow: Browse ‚Üí Identify ‚Üí Extract

**This is THE killer feature of Catclip** - the ability to browse files with line numbers, identify exactly what you need, and surgically extract just those lines - all without ever leaving your terminal or opening an editor!

### The Magic Workflow

```bash
# Step 1: Browse any file with line numbers
catclipls config.yaml

# Step 2: Identify the exact lines you need (e.g., lines 45-67)
# Step 3: Extract just those lines to clipboard
catclipns config.yaml 45 67
```

**That's it!** You've just copied exactly what you needed without touching your mouse, opening an editor, or breaking your terminal flow.

### Real-World Power Examples

#### Debugging Code
```bash
# Browse the error log
catclipls error.log
# Found the stack trace at lines 234-289?
catclipns error.log 234 289
# Now paste it directly into your bug report!
```

#### Configuration Surgery
```bash
# Review nginx config
catclipls /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
# Need just the SSL section (lines 80-95)?
catclipns /etc/nginx/nginx.conf 80 95
# Paste it into your new server config!
```

#### Code Extraction
```bash
# Browse a Python file
catclipls utils.py
# Found that perfect function at lines 156-184?
catclipns utils.py 156 184
# Paste it into your new script!
```

#### Building Scripts from Pieces
```bash
# Browse multiple files and extract the best parts
catclipls old_script.sh      # Find the initialization (lines 1-25)
catclipns old_script.sh 1 25  # Copy it

catclipls lib/functions.sh    # Find the validation function (lines 89-120)
catclipns lib/functions.sh 89 120  # Copy it

catclipls deploy.sh           # Find the cleanup section (lines 200-215)
catclipns deploy.sh 200 215   # Copy it
# You've just assembled a new script from the best parts of existing ones!
```

### Why This Changes Everything

- **Stay in the terminal** - No context switching to editors
- **Surgical precision** - Copy exactly what you need, nothing more
- **Visual browsing** - See line numbers to identify sections quickly
- **Speed** - Browse ‚Üí Extract ‚Üí Paste in seconds
- **No mouse required** - Pure keyboard workflow

This workflow alone can save you hours every week by eliminating the constant switching between terminal and editor just to copy specific sections of files.

## Command Reference

### Basic File Operations

```bash
catclip <file>           # Copy file contents to clipboard
catclipl <file>          # Copy with line numbers
catclips <file>          # Copy and display on screen
catclipls <file>         # Copy with line numbers AND show
catclipn <file> <start> <end>  # Copy specific line range
catclipns <file> <start> <end> # Copy line range AND show
```

### Directory Operations

```bash
pwdclip                  # Copy current directory path
pwdclips                 # Copy current path AND show
lsclip [options]         # Copy directory listing
lsclips [options]        # Copy listing AND show
treeclip [options]       # Copy tree output
treeclips [options]      # Copy tree AND show
clipshow                 # Display clipboard contents with stats
```

### Multi-File Support

```bash
catclip file1.txt file2.txt    # Copy multiple files
catclip *.py                   # Copy all Python files
catclip src/*.js              # Copy all JavaScript files in src/
```

### Understanding the Output

When you successfully copy content, you'll see:
```
‚úì Contents of 'myfile.txt' copied to clipboard using xclip
```

For multiple files:
```
‚úì Contents of 3 files copied to clipboard: file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```

## Advanced Usage

### Cross-Platform Clipboard Support

Catclip automatically detects and uses the best clipboard utility available:

1. **xclip** (X11 - most common)
2. **xsel** (X11 alternative)  
3. **wl-copy** (Wayland)

No configuration needed - it just works!

### File Type Intelligence

Catclip adds helpful separators when copying multiple files:

```bash
catclip config.py utils.py
```

Creates clipboard content like:
```
# === config.py ===
[config.py contents]

# === utils.py ===
[utils.py contents]
```

### Large File Handling

Catclip handles large files efficiently:
- Files over 1MB get a confirmation prompt
- Memory usage is monitored and reported
- Streaming processing for very large files

### Error Handling

Catclip provides clear, helpful error messages:

```bash
catclip nonexistent.txt
# Error: File 'nonexistent.txt' not found

catclipn script.py 50 25  
# Error: Start line (50) cannot be greater than end line (25)
```

## Configuration & Customization

### Environment Variables

Customize Catclip behavior with environment variables:

```bash
# Force specific clipboard utility
export CATCLIP_CLIPBOARD_CMD="xclip"

# Set custom file separator for multi-file copies  
export CATCLIP_SEPARATOR="# --- FILE: %s ---"

# Disable confirmation for large files
export CATCLIP_CONFIRM_LARGE="false"

# Set large file threshold (default: 1MB)
export CATCLIP_LARGE_FILE_MB="5"
```

### Plugin Configuration

Add these settings to your `.zshrc` for custom behavior:

```bash
# Custom aliases for your workflow
alias cc='catclip'           # Shorter command
alias ccl='catclipl'         # Copy with line numbers
alias ccs='catclips'         # Copy and show

# Integration with your editor
alias vclip='catclip $(fzf)' # Use fzf to select file to copy
```

## Workflow Integration Examples

## Troubleshooting

### Clipboard Not Working?

1. **Check available clipboard utilities:**
```bash
which xclip xsel wl-copy
```

2. **Install a clipboard utility:**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install xclip

# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install xclip
